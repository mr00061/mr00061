#Open to collaboration in molecular dynamics simulations using NAAMD and AMBER for protein, drug discovery, nuecleic acid simulations. Proficient in writing script in BASH, TCL, and python. I can use efficiently loos, vmd, pymol, discovery, chimera, modeller for homology modeling. One of my part of research in MS spectrometry. If anyone interested to know, lipid-protein interaction, drug-protein interaction can comunicate with me. Our lab has developed a very soft ionization technique it can intact a protein-lipid conjugacy.
